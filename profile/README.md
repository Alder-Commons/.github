Alder Commons is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit community space where kids and adults alike attend workshops and classes, and spend their time freely. A multigenerational and multicultural community, we practice and promote our [Core Values](https://aldercommons.org/philosophy/core-values/) of Self-Determination, Collective Liberation, and Community Support.

All of the 15+ programs that we host every week are either free or offered with sliding-scale fees. Our 300+ [Members](https://aldercommons.org/membership/) use our space as an affordable office alternative, as a space to play and learn, as their artist studios, and even as a place to run their food-based businesses. Members include coworkers, artists, organizations, families, and [self-directed learners](https://aldercommons.org/unschooling/) of all ages. 

Over a dozen other nonprofits are part of the community as [Organizational Members](https://aldercommons.org/organizational-membership/).
